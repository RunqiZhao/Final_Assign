On any given week, teachers and/or parents leverage our product, Mystery Science, to help their children stay curious. Roughly 2 million kids view our content on a weekly basis alone. While we are proud of this accomplishment, we have an ambitious goal of reaching every elementary school student in the country. In short, we are growing quickly and with growth...comes lots of data!
As a Data Scientist at Mystery.org, you will be granted the freedom to use your data analytics and experimentation skills across the organization. You'll join a 4 person Growth team made up of 2 other data scientists, a lead growth engineer, and our Director of Growth. You’ll work cross-functionally to answer our most important questions by innovating and uncovering breakthroughs.
You will report to Huey Kwik, our Director of Growth. We are headquartered in San Francisco and this position is open to both local and remote US-based candidates.

About You
Can you translate questions from non-technical stakeholders into decisions that can be answered with data?
Can you communicate complicated/foreign concepts or methodology to non-experts?
Are you familiar with Python? Numerical & analytical programming (i.e. pandas, scipy, etc)? SQL? Experimentation?
Do you have basic proficiency in statistics and statistical modeling?
Do you have experience, knowledge or interest in one or more of the following areas: Practical A/B testing for websites, feature engineering, predictive modeling (including using models in production), familiarity with machine learning algorithms?
About Mystery.org

At Mystery.org, we believe it’s important that children stay curious as they grow up. We will ensure that the next generation sees it’s an amazing world we live in, full of possibility and wonder — and that they learn how to figure things out for themselves.

We’re doing this by building the missing internet for children. Our first tool was created for children to use in the classroom. We have teachers signed up from 89% of elementary schools in the U.S. and now 50% of schools use us every month. We’ve created one of the fastest-growing learning resources and a brand that is loved by children. Now, we’re developing a new version of our product for parents and children to use at home.

For three years running, our sales have doubled. We’ve exceeded $10M in annual recurring revenue and are growing quickly.

When we talk about “the missing internet for children,” we intend to give children an experience that grownups take for granted: the ability to instantly explore anything they wonder about. Most adults don't realize how inaccessible knowledge is to children. For their first ten years of life, any time a child wonders something all they can do is ask grownups: parents at home and teachers at school. There are 1 billion children in the world today, and we’re making it possible for them to explore their questions, wherever they are. Over the past decade, grownups have been given this superpower but children have been left behind. So we're collecting every question children ask and creating video explanations for all of them. We think this will be the most important learning tool ever created.

Meet The Team

On your first day at Mystery.org, you’ll meet a group of 50 people who are passionate about learning and who each love their respective crafts. Our co-founder, Doug Peltz, began by assembling a team of the best explainers in the world from the Exploratorium, Klutz, Stanford, the Field Museum, and leading private schools. Our CEO, Keith Schacht, followed this by building a team of strong product engineers and designers. Keith was previously at Facebook as the product manager for News Feed and Messenger.

We have a strong focus on people that extends to every area of the company. We’re building the team that we want to work with.

The team at Mystery.org believes in the power of diversity and we hope you do too! We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply.

If you are inspired by our mission and passionate about helping teachers succeed and transforming science education for kids, we’d like to hear from you!"

Intelligence, humility, candor, and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced and sometimes mildly chaotic startup environment.
Desire to get things right and ship things quickly, and an appreciation for what it takes to balance the inherent conflict between the two.
A desire to learn and grow as a data scientist, while getting a lot of autonomy and experience early in your career.
Skills and Qualifications

Art history majors are welcome - we are strong believers in personal growth and care more about what you have done at work the past three years and what you are capable of doing now than we do about where you went to school or what you studied.
