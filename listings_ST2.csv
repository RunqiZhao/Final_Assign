GENERAL SUMMARY/ OVERVIEW STATEMENT
Unique opportunity to join an interdisciplinary team bridging the Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. The Rheinbay Lab and Lawrence Lab at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center seek well-qualified candidates to join a team of computational biologists working at the forefront of cancer research and treatment. We use computation as a powerful microscope to study both the fundamental biology of cancer initiation and progression, as well the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients in the hospital setting.
Cancer driver genes: tumors grow because of specific driver mutations that deactivate tumor suppressors or activate oncogenes. We are working to complete our understanding of the full catalog of cancer's ""box of tricks"".
Resistance to targeted therapies: single drugs targeting specific driver mutations can be effective for a while, but the cancer invariably discovers a work-around. We are actively investigating mechanisms of drug resistance and how to combat it.Single-cell sequencing: New approaches allow us to dissect a tumor down to single cells and investigate the RNA expression or DNA mutations in each cell. Understanding intratumoral heterogeneity is shedding new light on cancer progression and patient outcomes.Liquid biopsies: novel state-of-the-art technologies are starting to allow us to monitor the progression of cancer (both before, during, and after treatment) through a simple blood draw. We are actively working to overcome analytical challenges inherent in the study of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).Mutational processes: our genomes accumulate mutations from environmental agents such as ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke, as well as from intrinsic processes like errors during DNA replication. Studying these mutational background patterns can tell us what repair pathways are broken in a specific tumor, perhaps pointing the way to an effective genotoxic therapy. We are working to develop novel DNA sequencing technologies for studying mutagenesis in model systems.Genomics of sex chromosomes in cancer: understand the genetic underpinnings of different incidence and outcome between men and women patients
Principal Duties
Work with Cancer Center researchers to understand experimental procedures and the kinds of data produced (e.g. DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, epigenetic readouts, clinical outcome annotations). Meet and discuss with clinical and experimental colleagues to identify analytical challenges and goals.
Apply existing and novel algorithms to cancer data sets, analyze data quality, critically review and analyze results, communicate results to biologists, computational biologists, software engineers and clinicians.
Explore novel data visualization tools, with emphasis on integrating diverse data types and extracting clinically relevant insights.
Contribute to scientific writing and creation of data figures to be included in research publications reporting novel discoveries made in the lab and clinic.
Required Skills and Qualifications
B.A/B.S. in one of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or a related quantitative discipline.Independent, self-motivated drive to push research forward.Excellent programming skills (using any of Matlab, R, Java, Python, Perl, C, etc.)Nimble approach to programming and data analysis, with an emphasis on simple, intuitive, reasoning: quickly open unfamiliar datasets, generate simple visualizations to project the data onto our brains as usefully as possible, to stimulate hypothesis generation and the next steps of the analysis.Comfort using Word, Excel, Powerpoint or Google Suite tools to communicate results between team members.Ability to work together with multi-disciplinary teams comprising physicians, biologists, statisticians, and software engineers.Strong organizational and record-keeping skillsFluency in spoken and written EnglishExperience in ""machine learning"" welcomed

Provision of technical solutions and advice on statistical methodology and principles
Advising and assisting with post hoc analysis of legacy data sets
Assist the executive leadership team with developing and defining frameworks for decision-making (tenets) to guide and inform future experimental design choices
Initially, it is expected that approximately 75% of the Statistician’s time will be oriented toward pre-clinical and manufacturing activities and 25% or less time directed at clinical-stage activities. Depending on seniority and interests, the team will expand along with the demands of this fast-growing organization, presenting potential opportunities for broader responsibilities.

Desired Qualifications & Requirements
Education and Experience:
Bachelor’s degree in a field of statistics; master’s degree or doctorate preferred

This role will provide YOU the opportunity to lead key activities to progress YOUR career. The responsibilities for Lead Statistician include some of the following:
Work with partners in Clinical Pharmacology, Biology and Discovery Medicine to integrate all relevant sources of data (PK, biology, physiology, disease/safety PD) into quantitative models that predict outcomes in humans at both the population level and the specific study design level.
Ensure the statistical robustness of prediction models (whose outputs are used to define asset progression decisions) such that all relevant uncertainty is correctly propagated through such models in order to inform the estimate of risk-discharge for any particular development plan option. In particular, to ensure that FTIH study designs and progression decision-making checkpoints accurately reflect this translation modelling progress and that consequently there are clear and defensible decision rules for asset progression at C2FTIH and C2Dev based on the Three Pillars and Quantitative Decision-Making framework.
TS statistician and clinical statistician will communicate frequently, work closely to ensure no overlap in roles, and no confusion within the Early Development Team (EDT). TS statistician is accountable for statistical activities up to C2FTIH and will fully transfer accountability at that milestone.
Effectively contribute to and defend the asset plans presented at various internal governance boards such as GSB, RRB, RIB, CPEM PRF and CPEM matrix, at meetings with regulatory authorities, external partners and external key opinion leaders.
Development of novel quantitative models to build predictive relationship among variables.
Contribute to optimization of early clinical development strategies and alignment with early medicine profile to inform appropriate development decisions.
As early as possible in the asset’s journey
Characterise, for the priority indication(s) of the asset, the “golden thread” of experiments, endpoints and observed effect sizes that form a pathway from its current position to a successful registration.
Describes a strategy for quantitatively integrating the outcomes of each experiment on the thread to update probability of success and to illustrate risk discharge.
Identifies sources of uncertainty, influential/strong assumptions and limitations in current knowledge about the thread. Suggests strategies and options for discharging uncertainties, testing assumptions, and filling in knowledge gaps.
Describes what aspects of the “golden thread” are amenable to modelling, what could be investigated (in both resource constrained / unconstrained scenarios), and what is never likely to be attainable/predictable without performing large/long clinical trials.
Why you?
Basic Qualifications:
We are looking for professionals with these required skills to achieve our goals:
Master’s degree in Statistics or Biostatistics

About Go

We're building the world’s first Social Life platform; it’s called Go. Use it to plan some binge-watching of a Netflix series with a buddy, have a potluck with your close friends, plan a great night out with a date, see a concert, make it on time for the best happy hour you never knew about with old friends, or find and enroll in a nearby yoga (or boxing, or rock climbing…) class that fits perfectly in your schedule. If you’re feeling adventurous, check out a list of the best stuff happening in your city that you love or are visiting, or explore new activities that you’ve always wanted to experience but don’t know where to start (and don’t have time and motivation to research it all on the internet).

All of that ‘stuff’, well, it’s what makes our worlds go-round; because that’s what life is about. Friends. Family. Community. Love. Adventure. So, instead of staring down at a smartphone at all hours of the day opining on things that your community has already done. Go creates a world where every post on your feed is something you can actually go and do. A platform that helps you plan and coordinate and get out there. Off the screen and into the fray of real life. That’s Go.

We’re not gonna lie: Go is early-stage. But we’re funded, led by an incredible, passionate, and prestigious team, and have a product that very well may make the world a better place. We’re not Uber for cats, or some weird new drink or delivery service. We’re attempting to solve the monumental problem of social rift. We believe that a path back from a post-fact, post-community world is one that starts with a cup of coffee with an old friend. Or a bike ride. Any time you’re off you’re social media feeds and hanging out with others. A technology company devoted to making life better through empowering people to build and enrich real-life relationships with friends, family, and community.

Go is founded on the belief that a healthy social life is fundamentally made up of two things: spending time with people and doing the things that you want to do. It’s that simple: People should do what they love and be free to live the best life possible. Social technology should help us in real life by promoting human agency and self-actualization, and must stand against exploitation and the monetisation of its users and their personal data. Our world and environment has untapped and unknown richness, beauty and potential. Happiness is contagious whether found through extraordinary events or shared simple and mundane experiences. Tech can help happiness grow and make life better - in the real world.

Asthma and COPD are two of the most frustrating challenges in healthcare. In the last 50 years, we've made huge leaps in developing new medicines and understanding the complexity of these diseases. Yet despite this progress, patients today aren't doing as well as they could be. Medicines aren't used correctly or consistently, and doctors don't have the tools they need to deliver personalized treatment.

Propeller Health is changing that. We are the leading digital health company in respiratory care. Our technology helps patients and their doctors understand their disease, informs better treatment decisions and improves the quality of life of people living with asthma or COPD.

Candidates who identify as members of historically underrepresented groups in technology and healthcare are highly encouraged to apply. An inclusive and equitable culture is at the heart of our organization. Growing a diverse team is key to understanding our patients better and accomplishing our mission: to make life better for every person and community affected by chronic respiratory disease.

What's In It For You
Work with a smart, creative and diverse team of professionals. Solving respiratory disease requires a wide array of disciplines to work together. For example, we have epidemiologists, physicians/clinicians on staff combined with regulatory experts, statisticians and data scientists to build the best respiratory solution possible.
We care about balancing work with the rest of life. We encourage and support our team members to disconnect when they're not working.
Connecting as a team is important to us. We create plenty of opportunities to get together, such as regular summer cookouts for lunch, after work events like board game and hobby night, and our annual company-wide camping trip! You can opt in where it makes sense for you.

 - (3114543)Unique opportunity to join an interdisciplinary team bridging the Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. The Lawrence Lab and Haas Lab at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center seeks well-qualified candidates to join a cross-disciplinary team of biochemists, biologists, and clinicians working at the forefront of cancer research and treatment. We use biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and statistical data analysis to study both the fundamental biology of cancer initiation and progression, as well the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients in the hospital setting.Current research interests of the groups: Cancer evolution: Cancer is a process of Darwinian evolution occurring inside the patient's body, with an ongoing competition between cells to proliferate aggressively. Changing pressures on the cells, from treatment with chemotherapy or targeted agents, changes the dynamics of this evolution and can lead to one group (clone) of cells displacing another. We use genomic profiling to observe the processes of clonal evolution during the course of a patient's disease and treatment. Resistance to targeted therapies: Single drugs targeting specific driver mutations can be effective for a while, but the cancer invariably discovers a way to evolve resistance to the drug. We are actively investigating mechanisms of drug resistance and how to combat it. Single-cell sequencing: New approaches allow us to dissect a tumor down to single cells and investigate the RNA expression or DNA mutations in each cell. Understanding intra-tumoral heterogeneity is shedding new light on cancer progression and patient outcomes. Liquid biopsies: novel state-of-the-art technologies are starting to allow us to monitor the progression of cancer (both before, during, and after treatment) through a simple blood draw. We are actively working to overcome analytical challenges inherent in the study of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Mutational processes: Our genomes accumulate mutations from environmental agents such as ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke, as well as from intrinsic processes like errors during DNA replication. Studying these mutational background patterns can tell us what repair pathways are broken in a specific tumor, perhaps pointing the way to an effective genotoxic therapy. We are working to develop novel DNA sequencing technologies for studying mutagenesis in model systems. Cancer driver genes: Tumors grow because of specific driver mutations that deactivate tumor suppressors or activate oncogenes. We are working to complete our understanding of the full catalog of cancer's ""box of tricks"".Role Description:As a Biochemist, you will use state-of-the-art technologies to assist in sample preparation, testing, and analysis, using biochemistry and mass spectrometry, followed by statistical data analysis. You will contribute to writing reports and creating visualizations of biochemistry experimental results and communicate our findings to our collaborators in other MGH laboratories and clinical groups.
Responsibilities:Possess an understanding of laboratory procedures and under general supervision can conduct complex analysis.
Perform a variety of routine sample preparation and analysis procedures to quantitatively measure pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical compounds in a variety of formulations and/or biological matrices for stability and analytical testing.
Train on routine operation, maintenance and theory of analytical instrumentation, SOPs and regulatory guidelines.
Responsible for review and compilation of results and data comparison against SOP acceptance criteria, methodology, protocol and product specifications.B.A./B.S. (M.A./M.S. preferred) in Biochemistry.

Asthma and COPD are two of the most frustrating challenges in healthcare. In the last 50 years, we've made huge leaps in developing new medicines and understanding the complexity of these diseases. Yet despite this progress, patients today aren't doing as well as they could be. Medicines aren't used correctly or consistently, and doctors don't have the tools they need to deliver personalized treatment.

Propeller Health is changing that. We are the leading digital health company in respiratory care. Our technology helps patients and their doctors understand their disease, informs better treatment decisions and improves the quality of life of people living with asthma or COPD.

Candidates who identify as members of historically underrepresented groups in technology and healthcare are highly encouraged to apply. An inclusive and equitable culture is at the heart of our organization. Growing a diverse team is key to understanding our patients better and accomplishing our mission: to make life better for every person and community affected by chronic respiratory disease.

Consider Joining Us If You Are
Eager to work at a fast-paced, agile company on a self-governed, highly collaborative cross-functional team
Naturally curious, and believe in lifelong personal growth
Not afraid to experiment and fail. Failure is an opportunity to learn, and is embraced as a core tenet of Propeller.
A believer that technology can help solve hard problems and change the world
Aware that technology, by itself, does not delight customers; the sweet spot is when we combine technology with practical solutions, surprises, utility, and social interaction
A good listener who respects their colleagues, but who isn't afraid to assert themselves
An owner. You pick work up off the floor, guide collaboration, challenge assumptions, and solve hard problems
What We're Looking For
We're looking for people with 6-8+ years of real-world programming experience
Experience leading technical decisions
Fearlessness and a comfort with uncertainty. You have an acumen for turning complex problems into actionable plans
What You Will Do

You'll imagine, develop, document, support, and maintain our core API and the ecosystem of services connected to it. You will:
Write readable, maintainable, testable code
Ship features often
Communicate regularly, and overcome ""blocks""
Create software you're proud of, and that consumers love
What's In It For You
Work with a smart, creative and diverse team of professionals. Solving respiratory disease requires a wide array of disciplines to work together. For example, we have epidemiologists, physicians/clinicians on staff combined with regulatory experts, statisticians and data scientists to build the best respiratory solution possible.
We care about balancing work with the rest of life. We encourage and support our team members to disconnect when they're not working.
Connecting as a team is important to us. We create plenty of opportunities to get together, such as regular summer cookouts for lunch, after work events like board game and hobby night, and our annual company-wide camping trip! You can opt in where it makes sense for you.
A great office location in downtown Madison, steps from fun restaurants and shops!
