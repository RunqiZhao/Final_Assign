GENERAL SUMMARY/ OVERVIEW STATEMENT
Unique opportunity to join an interdisciplinary team bridging the Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. The Rheinbay Lab and Lawrence Lab at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center seek well-qualified candidates to join a team of computational biologists working at the forefront of cancer research and treatment. We use computation as a powerful microscope to study both the fundamental biology of cancer initiation and progression, as well the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients in the hospital setting.
Cancer driver genes: tumors grow because of specific driver mutations that deactivate tumor suppressors or activate oncogenes. We are working to complete our understanding of the full catalog of cancer's ""box of tricks"".
Resistance to targeted therapies: single drugs targeting specific driver mutations can be effective for a while, but the cancer invariably discovers a work-around. We are actively investigating mechanisms of drug resistance and how to combat it.Single-cell sequencing: New approaches allow us to dissect a tumor down to single cells and investigate the RNA expression or DNA mutations in each cell. Understanding intratumoral heterogeneity is shedding new light on cancer progression and patient outcomes.Liquid biopsies: novel state-of-the-art technologies are starting to allow us to monitor the progression of cancer (both before, during, and after treatment) through a simple blood draw. We are actively working to overcome analytical challenges inherent in the study of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).Mutational processes: our genomes accumulate mutations from environmental agents such as ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke, as well as from intrinsic processes like errors during DNA replication. Studying these mutational background patterns can tell us what repair pathways are broken in a specific tumor, perhaps pointing the way to an effective genotoxic therapy. We are working to develop novel DNA sequencing technologies for studying mutagenesis in model systems.Genomics of sex chromosomes in cancer: understand the genetic underpinnings of different incidence and outcome between men and women patients
Principal Duties
Work with Cancer Center researchers to understand experimental procedures and the kinds of data produced (e.g. DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, epigenetic readouts, clinical outcome annotations). Meet and discuss with clinical and experimental colleagues to identify analytical challenges and goals.
Apply existing and novel algorithms to cancer data sets, analyze data quality, critically review and analyze results, communicate results to biologists, computational biologists, software engineers and clinicians.
Explore novel data visualization tools, with emphasis on integrating diverse data types and extracting clinically relevant insights.
Contribute to scientific writing and creation of data figures to be included in research publications reporting novel discoveries made in the lab and clinic.
Required Skills and Qualifications
B.A/B.S. in one of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or a related quantitative discipline.Independent, self-motivated drive to push research forward.Excellent programming skills (using any of Matlab, R, Java, Python, Perl, C, etc.)Nimble approach to programming and data analysis, with an emphasis on simple, intuitive, reasoning: quickly open unfamiliar datasets, generate simple visualizations to project the data onto our brains as usefully as possible, to stimulate hypothesis generation and the next steps of the analysis.Comfort using Word, Excel, Powerpoint or Google Suite tools to communicate results between team members.Ability to work together with multi-disciplinary teams comprising physicians, biologists, statisticians, and software engineers.Strong organizational and record-keeping skillsFluency in spoken and written EnglishExperience in ""machine learning"" welcomed

Translational Statistics is a functional line within Biostatistics providing quantitative support to translational medicine practice, which plays a strategic role in making sure discovery and clinical development activities align with the same ultimate goal in drug development. The line is part of Non-Clinical & Translational Statistics (NCTS), but the activities stretch beyond NCTS and include activities performed in clinical statistics.
This role will provide YOU the opportunity to lead key activities to progress YOUR career. The responsibilities for Lead Statistician include some of the following:
Work with partners in Clinical Pharmacology, Biology and Discovery Medicine to integrate all relevant sources of data (PK, biology, physiology, disease/safety PD) into quantitative models that predict outcomes in humans at both the population level and the specific study design level.
Ensure the statistical robustness of prediction models (whose outputs are used to define asset progression decisions) such that all relevant uncertainty is correctly propagated through such models in order to inform the estimate of risk-discharge for any particular development plan option. In particular, to ensure that FTIH study designs and progression decision-making checkpoints accurately reflect this translation modelling progress and that consequently there are clear and defensible decision rules for asset progression at C2FTIH and C2Dev based on the Three Pillars and Quantitative Decision-Making framework.
TS statistician and clinical statistician will communicate frequently, work closely to ensure no overlap in roles, and no confusion within the Early Development Team (EDT). TS statistician is accountable for statistical activities up to C2FTIH and will fully transfer accountability at that milestone.
Effectively contribute to and defend the asset plans presented at various internal governance boards such as GSB, RRB, RIB, CPEM PRF and CPEM matrix, at meetings with regulatory authorities, external partners and external key opinion leaders.
Development of novel quantitative models to build predictive relationship among variables.
Contribute to optimization of early clinical development strategies and alignment with early medicine profile to inform appropriate development decisions.
As early as possible in the asset’s journey
Characterise, for the priority indication(s) of the asset, the “golden thread” of experiments, endpoints and observed effect sizes that form a pathway from its current position to a successful registration.
Describes a strategy for quantitatively integrating the outcomes of each experiment on the thread to update probability of success and to illustrate risk discharge.
Identifies sources of uncertainty, influential/strong assumptions and limitations in current knowledge about the thread. Suggests strategies and options for discharging uncertainties, testing assumptions, and filling in knowledge gaps.
Describes what aspects of the “golden thread” are amenable to modelling, what could be investigated (in both resource constrained / unconstrained scenarios), and what is never likely to be attainable/predictable without performing large/long clinical trials.
Why you?
Basic Qualifications:
We are looking for professionals with these required skills to achieve our goals:

About Go

We're building the world’s first Social Life platform; it’s called Go. Use it to plan some binge-watching of a Netflix series with a buddy, have a potluck with your close friends, plan a great night out with a date, see a concert, make it on time for the best happy hour you never knew about with old friends, or find and enroll in a nearby yoga (or boxing, or rock climbing…) class that fits perfectly in your schedule. If you’re feeling adventurous, check out a list of the best stuff happening in your city that you love or are visiting, or explore new activities that you’ve always wanted to experience but don’t know where to start (and don’t have time and motivation to research it all on the internet).

All of that ‘stuff’, well, it’s what makes our worlds go-round; because that’s what life is about. Friends. Family. Community. Love. Adventure. So, instead of staring down at a smartphone at all hours of the day opining on things that your community has already done. Go creates a world where every post on your feed is something you can actually go and do. A platform that helps you plan and coordinate and get out there. Off the screen and into the fray of real life. That’s Go.

We’re not gonna lie: Go is early-stage. But we’re funded, led by an incredible, passionate, and prestigious team, and have a product that very well may make the world a better place. We’re not Uber for cats, or some weird new drink or delivery service. We’re attempting to solve the monumental problem of social rift. We believe that a path back from a post-fact, post-community world is one that starts with a cup of coffee with an old friend. Or a bike ride. Any time you’re off you’re social media feeds and hanging out with others. A technology company devoted to making life better through empowering people to build and enrich real-life relationships with friends, family, and community.

Go is founded on the belief that a healthy social life is fundamentally made up of two things: spending time with people and doing the things that you want to do. It’s that simple: People should do what they love and be free to live the best life possible. Social technology should help us in real life by promoting human agency and self-actualization, and must stand against exploitation and the monetisation of its users and their personal data. Our world and environment has untapped and unknown richness, beauty and potential. Happiness is contagious whether found through extraordinary events or shared simple and mundane experiences. Tech can help happiness grow and make life better - in the real world.
