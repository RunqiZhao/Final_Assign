On any given week, teachers and/or parents leverage our product, Mystery Science, to help their children stay curious. Roughly 2 million kids view our content on a weekly basis alone. While we are proud of this accomplishment, we have an ambitious goal of reaching every elementary school student in the country. In short, we are growing quickly and with growth...comes lots of data!
As a Data Scientist at Mystery.org, you will be granted the freedom to use your data analytics and experimentation skills across the organization. You'll join a 4 person Growth team made up of 2 other data scientists, a lead growth engineer, and our Director of Growth. You’ll work cross-functionally to answer our most important questions by innovating and uncovering breakthroughs.
You will report to Huey Kwik, our Director of Growth. We are headquartered in San Francisco and this position is open to both local and remote US-based candidates.

About You
Can you translate questions from non-technical stakeholders into decisions that can be answered with data?
Can you communicate complicated/foreign concepts or methodology to non-experts?
Are you familiar with Python? Numerical & analytical programming (i.e. pandas, scipy, etc)? SQL? Experimentation?
Do you have basic proficiency in statistics and statistical modeling?
Do you have experience, knowledge or interest in one or more of the following areas: Practical A/B testing for websites, feature engineering, predictive modeling (including using models in production), familiarity with machine learning algorithms?
About Mystery.org

At Mystery.org, we believe it’s important that children stay curious as they grow up. We will ensure that the next generation sees it’s an amazing world we live in, full of possibility and wonder — and that they learn how to figure things out for themselves.

We’re doing this by building the missing internet for children. Our first tool was created for children to use in the classroom. We have teachers signed up from 89% of elementary schools in the U.S. and now 50% of schools use us every month. We’ve created one of the fastest-growing learning resources and a brand that is loved by children. Now, we’re developing a new version of our product for parents and children to use at home.

For three years running, our sales have doubled. We’ve exceeded $10M in annual recurring revenue and are growing quickly.

When we talk about “the missing internet for children,” we intend to give children an experience that grownups take for granted: the ability to instantly explore anything they wonder about. Most adults don't realize how inaccessible knowledge is to children. For their first ten years of life, any time a child wonders something all they can do is ask grownups: parents at home and teachers at school. There are 1 billion children in the world today, and we’re making it possible for them to explore their questions, wherever they are. Over the past decade, grownups have been given this superpower but children have been left behind. So we're collecting every question children ask and creating video explanations for all of them. We think this will be the most important learning tool ever created.

Meet The Team

On your first day at Mystery.org, you’ll meet a group of 50 people who are passionate about learning and who each love their respective crafts. Our co-founder, Doug Peltz, began by assembling a team of the best explainers in the world from the Exploratorium, Klutz, Stanford, the Field Museum, and leading private schools. Our CEO, Keith Schacht, followed this by building a team of strong product engineers and designers. Keith was previously at Facebook as the product manager for News Feed and Messenger.

We have a strong focus on people that extends to every area of the company. We’re building the team that we want to work with.

The team at Mystery.org believes in the power of diversity and we hope you do too! We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply.

Triplebyte is transforming the way software engineers are hired. Our mission is to build an open, valuable and skills-based credential for all engineers and data scientists. This is important because millions of people have skills (and deserve good jobs), but don't fit the profile that recruiters seek. We aim to cut out that noise by matching opportunities to people who have the skills to succeed in them - regardless of their background.

Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte's technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.

We raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 64 is growing! We're building out the leadership of our team to help us scale to the next phase.

Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.

As it stands now, it is obvious that early diagnostics is possible, however, there are practical challenges in terms of the accessibility and extensiveness of the actual test. Sognef was founded with the intent of providing a solution to a necessity that has been overlooked for decades because of the regimented shape of the industry where costs are high, automation and accessibility are low, consolidation and comprehensiveness is absent, and markets are geared towards specialized physicians preventing proper and effective early diagnostics/screening.Sognef’s vision is to have one, single liquid biopsy-based test that can provide early stage diagnostics for cancers, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, infectious, and rare diseases in a consolidated, cost-effective, simple, and practical manner. Around three to five years from now, when Sognef has developed diagnostic profiles or indications for all of its possible target diseases, the goal is to be able to provide any individual with a single blood test that can screen them for a whole range of diseases from common to uncommon to rare in a manner that is affordable, simple, and accurate. In the event that the individual who is regularly taking tests, develops a disease or condition (i.e. pancreatic cancer, Alzheimer’s, COPD), Sognef will be able to catch it in its earliest stages.For this role, the candidate will be responsible for designing and developing a bioinformatics and machine learning algorithm/platform from the ground up in accordance with provided goals and specifications.
